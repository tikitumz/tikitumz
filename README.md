- 👋 Hi, I’m Elaina, aka @tikitumz
- 🌱 I study two degrees; one in IT (Game Dev), the other in Design and Technology (Industrial Design) at Flinders University.
- 💞️ Outside of that, you'll find me planning/going on some overseas adventure, listening to music, or deep-diving into something design related.
