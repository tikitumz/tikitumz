- 👋 Hi, I’m Elaina, aka @tikitumz, from NZ, but call Adelaide (in Australia) home. 
- 👀 I’m interested in all things related to cloud, game art, cgi and vfx! I also want to learn c++ to help me with the techy side of Unreal Engine. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, azure, ansible...I'll add more later! I consider myself a noob for now. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on game-related projects, although I'll consider anything that helps me learn cloud, or speeds up my workflow for 3d modelling (in Maya) or anything in Nuke and Houdini! 
- 📫 You can reach me here, or on LinkedIn at linkedin.com/in/elaina-t
